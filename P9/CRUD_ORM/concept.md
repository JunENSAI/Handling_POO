## 1. The "Two Classes" Confusion

This is the hardest concept for beginners in FastAPI. You will have two classes named "User":

- **Pydantic Schema** (schemas.UserCreate): Used for validation (User sends this JSON).

- **SQLAlchemy Model** (models.User): Used for the Database (Python saves this Row).

**Why separate them?**

- **The Pydantic schema** might have a field confirm_password.

- **The Database model** should NOT have that column. It only needs the final hash.

`They serve different layers of the application.`

## 2. The Create Workflow

To save data, we follow 4 specific steps in SQLAlchemy:

- **Create Instance:** `db_user = User(email=..., password=...)`

- **Add:** `db.add(db_user)` (Put it in the staging area).

- **Commit:** `db.commit()`.

- **Refresh:** `db.refresh(db_user)` (Get the new ID generated by the DB).
